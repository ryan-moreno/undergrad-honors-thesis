  \Abstract{
Named entity recognition (NER) is a fundamental information extraction task attempting to extract named entities from a given text and classify them using pre-defined categories (e.g. persons, locations, or organizations) \citep{2007Survey}.
The standard protocol for obtaining an annotated NER dataset involves an annotator viewing a sentence, selecting token spans as entities, and labeling the spans with their entity types. 
Neural NER models are powerful in settings in which an abundance of ground-truth human-annotated training data is available \citep{LampleNER}. However, human annotation is expensive and time-consuming, especially in technical domains in which the human annotator must be able to understand and contextualize technical jargon. Thus, a crucial research question is how we can most efficiently collect and use human-annotated ground-truth data. 



In this thesis, I investigate two potential answers. 
First, I explore a novel technique for collecting human-annotated data by gathering both ground-truth entity labels and \textit{entity triggers} -- the phrases which cued the annotator that there was an entity. The entity triggers are used as additional supervision to train NER models. Our experiments demonstrate that annotating both the entities and triggers is more efficient than annotating only entities, allowing for state-of-the-art results using a significantly smaller amount of human annotations. 

Second, I explore automated methods to develop adversarial data, data which is created by perturbing a correctly classified example, causing the model to misclassify the adversarial example. Adversarial examples are useful because they demonstrate the limits of state-of-the-art NER models which can guide future research directions for making models more robust. My experiments demonstrate that the algorithms I develop to generate adversarial examples are effective at fooling state-of-the-art NER models. 
Further, I use these augmentation algorithms for adversarial training, in which the same adversarial techniques used to augment the test data and attack the model are used to augment the training data and train the model. My experiments show that adversarial training using my adversarial augmentation techniques improves the NER model's robustness to adversarial attacks while retaining its effectiveness on the original test data sets.
By developing these adversarial examples from existing human-annotated data in an automated manner, I efficiently use the annotations, garnering the benefits of adversarial attacks and adversarial training without additional human input.
